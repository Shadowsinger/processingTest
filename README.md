# Coding reminders
* DONT CHANGE ORIENTATION UNTIL COORDINATES ARE MULTIPLES OF 50!!!

# Maps
* Each map level starts with a line of `---`
* Lines that start with `#` will not be read

# How to Play
* Arrow keys for horizontal movement
* \<Space> for vertical movement (to be implemented)
* A,D for (relative) camera angle change 

# Todo List
* CLEAN UP SIZE SHIT FOR USER
* ~~Camera switching~~
* ~~Map generating~~
* Flight
* Prettier transitions in angle change
* Main character gravity, wall interaction
* Rooms/stages that use the mapGeneration

* Collect keys
* Scoreboard
* Ghost algorithms
* Dr. Strange-style portals
* Walking on walls
